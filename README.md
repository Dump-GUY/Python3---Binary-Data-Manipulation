# Python3 - Binary-Data-Manipulation
Python 3 - Manipulation and conversion with different data types (Bytes operations)

I created this repo to help anybody with some examples of Data type conversion in Python 3. I will be adding more examples.
Also as I am scripting in more languages sometimes I forget basics and this could serves as easy refresh.
I will focus usually on malware anlysis - only on binary/byte operations, encryption/decryption and examples of implementation.

This repo is not about excellent scripting in python, it will only serve to help or find inspiration for others.
Hope that somebody will find it useful and save some time with it.

Recommended to start with MAIN_Data_type_manipulation_conversion.py
